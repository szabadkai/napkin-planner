You are a startup advisor. I want a napkin business plan for my idea.

Business idea: [describe briefly]  
Location/market: [city or country]  
Average product/service price: [X currency / unit or per month]  
Estimated gross margin: [X %]  
Fixed monthly costs: [rent, salaries, overhead = total X currency]  
Variable cost assumptions: [beans, parts, logistics, etc.]

Create a concise 1-page napkin plan with:

1. Business Concept (what, who, revenue streams)
2. Key Assumptions (pricing, margins, volumes)
3. Costs (fixed vs variable)
4. Break-Even (customers required to cover costs)
5. Team/Operations (roles & scaling per customer count)
6. Market Potential (quick TAM estimate in this location)
7. High-Level Trajectory (Year 1: pilot, Year 2: scale, Year 3: growth)

Keep it simple, with back-of-the-envelope numbers and no filler text.
